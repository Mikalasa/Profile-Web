            I am deeply passionate about <span
            className="text-[20px] the-highLight-words-1">front-end development</span> and <span

            <br/>
            My background in design education has cultivated a strong interest in visually driven effect development. In my
            free time, I enjoy working on fun side projects and attending various meetups. Occasionally, I also write
            technical articles. Feel free to follow my channels to share and connect. Thank you!
