            network security, and databases through courses and projects. My in-depth study of Java, 
            especially mastering object-oriented programming, enhanced my coding skills and led me from front-end to back-end development. 
            This journey expanded my technical scope and gave me a thorough understanding of the software development lifecycle, 
            including analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance.`
